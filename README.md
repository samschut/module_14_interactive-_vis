# module_14_interactive-_vis
Create a website with interactive visualizations of belly button flora. An interactive bubble and bar chart are plotted using plotly based on the culture id and the number of bacteria corresponding to it. The website will update the charts with a dropdown interactive button the user can use to choose the culture id and what number were found.
